# Lesson 2.10 - Accessibility overview

* Good accessibility or "a11y" is crucial to making sure all users can access the content in your sites and applications.

* We often shorten the word "accessibility" to "a11y" because there's 11 letters between the "A" and "Y" in the word "Accessibility". Sometimes you'll see this pattern used in other contexts like i18n for "internationalization" and l10n for "localization".
